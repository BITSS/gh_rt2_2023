    “An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it’s merely scholarship advertisement. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.”

# Data Sharing: Past 

.font120[
- Distant past: In economics data was rarely available until the early 2000's (Dewalt et. al. 1986, McCullough et al. 2006, [Vilhuber 2020](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/fgpmpj1l/release/5#vlxgrqs1os))

- Not so distant past: But even after the first policies were put in place most data sets where incomplete (Gertler et. al. 2018) 

- However a clear change in norms has taken place over the last decade (Ferguson et. al. 2023):

# Data Sharing: Present  
<br>
.font140[

- Founders are playing a key role by requiring data availability 
  - Latest milestone: [Nelson Memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-access-Memo.pdf)

- Ever-growing infrastructure with solutions. For example: 
  - [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/)
  - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
  - [Dryad (larger datasets)](https://datadryad.org/stash)
  - [OSF](https://osf.io/)
  - [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/)
  - See [here](https://www.agu.org/-/media/files/publications/generalist-data-repository-grid.pdf) for a comparison and more alternatives of trusted data repositories

# Data Sharing: Future

.font120[
- Rise of administrative data sets in economics
  - Recent revelations of high profile fraud (Harvard, Duke) where only possible because the data was available. 
  - For a large fraction of research in economics, we have no way of detecting such irregularities. 

- Data citations
  - Increasing the practice of citing data sets in addition to the paper could help align incentives even more. 
 
- Data provenance 
  - Tracing and documenting the origin of different data sets can serve two purposes: (i) share more effectively the knowledge of what it takes to build a given data sets, and (ii) give credit to the proper sources in the process of doing this.

# Code Sharing: Git/Github for Non-Programmers  
.font150[
<br>
- Version Control Software (VCS) is an increasingly popular tool for computational reproducibility

- Git is a type of VCS and Github company that build on top of.   

- They are very popular among programmers, but not so much among non-programmers. 

- Why? I believe it has to do with GUIs.

]
---

# What is a GUI and why the bad reputation

.font150[
<br><br>
**G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface   

- For most of us (non-programmers): *GUI = Software*.  

- GUIs are behind the popularization of personal computers. 

- Unfortunately GUIs are pretty bad at keeping a record of actions taken (bad for reproducibility).
]

---

# What is not a GUI?

.font140[  

- Any software that is run in the command line (aka terminal, shell, bash, etc).  

]

![](Images/command_line.png)

.font140[ 

- Git was designed to run in the command line.

- Today we will learn Git **without** the command line.
]

---

# What is Git 1/2
.font150[
<br>
- Git is a software designed to track the **entire** history of the code of a project. 

- Designed originally for software development, it has gained important traction in the research community. 

- Main appeal: facilitates full reproducibility and collaboration. 

- Git is mainly meant to work as a non-GUI (in the command line) software.   
**However:** most of the key features can be used through a GUI. 
]
---

# What is Git 2/2

.font150[ 
<br>
- By code Git understands any type of plain text file (`myfile.R`, `myfile.do`, `.tex/.md/.txt/.csv/.etc`).

- This type of file can be understood as "human readable" as machine and human see the same fie. 

- Files that are "non-human readable" are called binary files (`myfile.docx`, `myfile.xlxs`, `.pdf/.exe/.dta/.etc`).

- Git can also detect changes in binary files, but it cannot show those changes.
]

---

# What is Github
.font150[
<br>
- Github is a company that provides two services (that we care of): 
  - A web hosting service for all our files track with Git (public free/private $ or free if academic).  
  - A GUI software (Desktop App) that provides user friendly access to Git.

- Others hosting ss include: Bitbucket, GitLab, Gitkraken, etc. 

- Other GUIs include: SourceTree, Gitkraken, VS Code, RStudio.

# The Primary Goal of Version Control (for us)

.font150[
<br><br>
**The Goal:** keep track of any *potentially meaningful* modification to your code.  
]
--
.font150[
**Secondary Goal:** learn how to collaborate with others using Github.   
]


---
# Strategy 1:  

.font150[
<br>
1. Agree on a naming convention with your co-authors (eg: YYYYMMDDfilename_INITALS).  

2. Begin working from the last saved version (eg: `20180325demo_FH.do`).  
3. At the end of the day, save on a new version (eg: `20180327demo_FH.do`).  

**Pros:** Easy adoption.   

**Cons:** Error prone, hard to document, lots of files for each document.     
]
---

# Strategy 2:  

.font150[
<br>

1. Name your file `filename` (ideally `01_filename`)  
2. Take a snapshot of your work every time you complete relevant change (day, hour or minutes).  
3. Update your entire working folder to the cloud.   


**Pros:** Error proof, seamless documentation, one file per document, track differences across all versions, meant to work with the cloud. 

**Cons:** Harder adoption.

# Other reasons to use Git

.font150[
<br><br>
- To access a whole new world of knowledge!    

- Great tool for collaboration.

# Demos

## Three Demos: 
<br>
.font140[

1 - **Simple but instructive.**   

2 - Repeat with collaboration: shared ownership.   

3 - Repeat with branches.  

]
---

# Demo #1: We Start in the Cloud 
<br>
.font130[

1 -  Create [github.com](github.com) account and sign in.   

2 -  Let's look at some **repos:**  
  - Papers: [Labor](https://github.com/tyleransom/AES-Roy-Majors), [Health](https://github.com/mkiang/opioid_treatment_distance), [Public Finance](https://github.com/OpportunityInsights/welfare_analysis)    
  - Courses: [So](https://github.com/edrubin/EC607S21), [many](https://github.com/floswald/ScPo-Labor/), [methods](https://github.com/woerman/ResEcon703), [courses](https://github.com/paulgp/applied-methods-phd) 
  - Covid: [JHU](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), [Imperial](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/covid19model), [NYT](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), [The Economist](https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-excess-deaths-tracker), [EconTracker](https://github.com/OpportunityInsights/EconomicTracker)

3 -  First way to access content: download.   

4 -  What if you want to have your own copy of the repo? **Fork** it!  

]
---
# Demo #1: We move to our local computer 
<br>
.font130[
5 -  Now create your own repo. Initiate readme and make some edits.   

6 - **Clone** the repo. Explore the files and location.   

7 - Create new files, edit. And **commit**. Edit again, and commit again.   

8 - **Push.** Edit on github.com, and **pull.**   

9 - For this tutorial, best way to access previous version: explore in github.com and download.

# Three Demos 2/3: 
<br>
.font140[

1 - Simple but instructive.   
    *Review: def repo, github.com, download, clone, destination folder, fork, create repo, commit, push, pull, delete, search repo, download old version.*   

2 - **Repeat with collaboration: shared ownership.**   

3 - Repeat with branches.  
  ]

---
# Two formats of collaboration  
<br>
.font140[


- Many owners, all can push.   
    - **Very** important to pull at the beginning and at before each push. 
    
- One owner, many pull requests (not covered here).  
    - Easier to control, requires constant updating of forks.   
    

]
  
---
# Demo #2: Many owners


.font140[

1 - Let's pretend that each of you represents two individuals: one working on your computer, and an alter-ego working on a different computer. 

2 - Only for the purpose of this tutorial, we will edit the content of a repo on GitHub.com, as-if it was done by your alter-ego in a different computer. 

]
--
.font140[
3 - You-you: edits, commits and **does not push.**  
]
--
.font140[
4 - Alter-You commits and pushes in **different lines** (in GitHub.com).     
]
--
.font140[
5 - Now you-you (the one on your local machine) pushes.
]
--
.font140[
6 - Repeat 3 - 5 but now both of you in the same lines.    
]

# Three Demos: 2/3 

<br>
.font140[


1 - Simple but instructive.   
    Review: def repo, github.com, download, clone, destination folder, fork, create repo, commit, push, pull, delete, search repo, download old version.  

2 - Repeat with collaboration: shared ownership.     
    *Review: Simulate collaboration, resolve conflicts.*
    
3 - Repeat with branches.  
    
    

]


---
# .font80[Demo #3: Branches and collaboration (we wil be here a while)]
<br>
.font140[

1 - Create a branch from previous repo.  

2 - Add new content (do not replace), commit a few times, and go back and forth to the main branch.  

3 - Go back to main branch (master), observe file, merge.  

4 - Look at the history of the main branch.   

5 - Push and inspect visual tool from GitHub

6 - Repeat 1-3 but now replace instead of adding content.

# Three Demos: 3/3 
.font140[
1 - Simple but instructive.   
    Review: def repo, github.com, download, clone, destination folder, fork, create repo, commit, push, pull, delete, search repo, download old version.  
   
2 - Repeat with collaboration: shared ownership.     
    Review: Simulate collaboration, resolve conflicts.
    
3 - Repeat with branches.  
    *Review: All of the above, plus: branch, merge, resolve conflicts.*  
]


---
# Now go and explore!
<br>
.font140[

Some good habits:   
- Commit often (<1hr)  

- Always pull before you start a new session of work. Also good to pull before pushing.    

- Think of your remote as the most important set of files. Get used to deleting things in your local machine.
